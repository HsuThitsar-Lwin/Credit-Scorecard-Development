# Credit Scorecard Development for High-Income Clients

## Project Overview
This project involves the development of a tailored credit scorecard aimed at assessing the creditworthiness of high-income individuals. By leveraging advanced data analytics techniques, the goal is to provide personalized, large-scale loans while minimizing default risks and maximizing profitability. The project showcases comprehensive data preparation, feature engineering, and predictive modeling techniques to create a robust scoring system.

## Key Features
- **Data Preparation**: 
  - Conducted thorough data cleaning and preprocessing on large, real-world datasets.
  - Addressed missing values, standardized inconsistent data, and removed outliers to ensure data quality.
  - Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and refine the target customer segment.

- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Developed insightful features such as income-to-loan ratios and median income comparisons, enhancing the predictive power of the model.
  - Applied feature selection techniques, including Information Value (IV) analysis, to choose the most relevant characteristics.

- **Statistical Analysis**:
  - Employed Chi-Square tests and ANOVA F-tests to validate the significance of selected variables, ensuring the reliability of the model.
  - Conducted correlation analysis to identify and manage multicollinearity issues among features.

- **Model Development**:
  - Trained a logistic regression model on a balanced dataset, incorporating techniques like class weight adjustments to handle imbalanced data.
  - Fine-tuned the model by adjusting for monotonicity and removing redundant variables, resulting in a more generalizable model with improved accuracy.

- **Pricing Strategy and Business Insights**:
  - Developed incentive-based and competitive pricing strategies to foster long-term client relationships and maintain a competitive edge.
